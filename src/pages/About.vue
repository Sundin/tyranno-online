    <h1>About Armory</h1>
    <p>Hyper Speed Metal from Hisingen Island in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>
    <p>Contact: armoryofficial@gmail.com</p>

    <p>
      Armory started out in 2012 and has been delivering hyperspeed metal since. After two
      demos the debut full length album <span class="title">World Peace... Cosmic War</span>
      was released via High Roller Records in 2016. The album got great reviews from all
      around the world and was priced "Album of the year" by Metal Invader.
      The band then got to share the stage with
      bigger bands such as Pentagram and Nifelheim. With all the new experience the band
      went into the studio again in late 2017 to record their second album.
      <span class="title">The Search</span> was
      released in July 2018 via High Roller and again the album got great reviews and it was
      proved that the songwriting had developed in the right direction. Today Armory are
      aiming to bring the band to the next level and to deliver their hyperspeed metal outside
      Scandinavia.
